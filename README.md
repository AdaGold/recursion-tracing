## Tracing through a recursive method

**You should trace through these recursive methods given the calls below. The ones we did in class have the answers in bold immediately following the question.**

### Trace #1
```
def mystery1(n)
  if n == 1
    return n
  else
    return n + mystery1(n-1)
  end
end
```

- What is mystery1(5)?
- What is mystery1(10)?
- What is mystery1(0)?

### Trace #2
```
def mystery2(n)
  if n < 10
    return n
  else
    return (n%10) + mystery2(n/10)
  end
end
```

- What is mystery2(123)? **3 + 2 + 1 = 6 ([Panopto](https://adaacademy.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=202b1920-9501-4fd3-ae41-7b35a50166ff) at 45:00)**
- What is mystery2(9005)? **5 + 0 + 0 + 9 = 14 ([Panopto](https://adaacademy.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=202b1920-9501-4fd3-ae41-7b35a50166ff) at 45:00)**
- What is mystery2(-123)?
- _Added Fun: How could we make `mystery2(-123)` work the way we might expect it to work instead of the way it does?_

### Trace #3
```
def mystery3(n)
  if n == 0
    return 100
  elsif n == -1
    return 200
  end
  if n%2 == 0
    return mystery3(n/2)
  else
    return mystery3(n-1)
  end
end
```

- What is mystery3(1)?
- What is mystery3(13)? **100 ([Panopto](https://adaacademy.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=202b1920-9501-4fd3-ae41-7b35a50166ff) at 1:09:00)**
- What is mystery3(-6)? **200 ([Panopto](https://adaacademy.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=202b1920-9501-4fd3-ae41-7b35a50166ff) at 1:09:00)**

### Trace #4
```
def mystery4(b,e)
  if e == 0
    return 1
  else
    return b * mystery4(b,e-1)
  end
end
```

- What is mystery4(10,2)?
- What is mystery4(4,3)?
- What is mystery4(5,0)?

### Trace #5
```
def mystery5(s)
  if s.length == 0
    return ""
  else
    return "*" + mystery5(s[1..-1])
  end
end
```

- What is mystery5("hi")?
- What is mystery5("")?
- What is mystery5("Hi, there!")?
- _Added Fun: How could we make only alphabetic characters to be changed to stars?_

## Writing a recursive method

**You should attempt at least 1 of the following problems. We did #1 together in class, so you will find that solution in the recursion.rb file. You can use the tracing problems above to help give you an idea of what the methods may look like at the end, but remember to look for patterns between multiple examples to help you generalize before writing the code.**

### Write #1
`factorial(n)`
Write a method `factorial` that accepts an integer parameter n and that uses recursion to compute and return the value of n factorial (also known as n!).

- e.g. fact(4) = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24

### Write #2
`reverse(s)`
Write a method `reverse` that accepts a string as a parameter
and then returns the reverse of the string.

- e.g. reverse("hello") = "olleh"

### Write #3
`bunny(n)`
Write a method `bunny` that accepts an integer parameter n. N represents a
number of bunnies and each bunny has two big floppy ears. We want to compute the total number of ears across all the bunnies recursively (without loops or multiplication).

- e.g. bunny(0) = 0
- e.g. bunny(1) = 2
- e.g. bunny(10) = 20

### Write #4
`nested(s)`
Write a method `nested` that accepts a string of only parenthesis
and then returns if those parenthesis are properly nested. You may
assume that no non-paren characters will be passed to this method.

- e.g. nested("((()))") = true
- e.g. nested("())") = false





## More Added Fun (optional)

### fib(n)
Write a recursive method `fib` that accepts an integer n as a parameter and returns the nth [fibonacci number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci#Fibonacci_sequence).

- e.g. fib(4) = (1 1 2) 3 = 3

### pal(s)
Write a recursive method `pal` that accepts a string s as a parameter and returns a boolean value indicating if that string is a [palindrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome) or not.

- e.g. pal("racecar") = true
- e.g. pal("smile") = false
